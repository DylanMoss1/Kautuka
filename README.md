# Automatic Parallelisation using Effect Tracking and Cost Analysis

An automatic-parallelisation compiler written in OCaml: compiling a user-annotated subset of sequential Go code into multithreaded Go code.

Award-winning: Awarded the Highly Commended Dissertation Award in the Computer Science Tripos for Part II 2023.

Utilises a mixture of effect tracking and cost analysis. Effect tracking determines whether two blocks of code can be run concurrently without interfering. Cost analysis combines static and dynamic analysis, to estimate both data-structure sizes and execution times for programs. This allows us to estimate whether parallelising two blocks of code will provide a runtime improvement. If blocks of code can be parallelised to reduce the program's runtime without interfering with each other, they are compiled into their parallelised form in the resulting multithreaded Go code.
